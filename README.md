 # Credit Card Default Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for credit card default prediction. Our objective is to develop a machine learning model for accurate prediction of credit card default probability. The dataset provided includes transactional data and customer information. The project structure includes directories for data, notebooks, models, and scripts. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, and execute the Jupyter notebooks sequentially. Contributions are welcome, and the trained models can be used for prediction and analysis.
